## Homework Description

```A PetClinic Registration Application where we use the Oop structure ```

- Important Note: 

- Because of the empty List<Pet> petRecords variable in the [PetList.dart]() file, when user press on "List Animals" button, application shows an empty page. The original list in the [PetOperations_Widget.dart](https://github.com/Kodluyoruz-Flutter-Bootcamp/week2-aytacaydemir/blob/main/hmw_2/hmw2/lib/Screens/PetScreens/PetOperations_Widget.dart) file tried to transfer but result was not successful. After fix of that problem, Pets are going to list in another view. 

- In this project, it was tried to be done by using the source [Sıla Kaçmaz - Library System](https://github.com/kacmazsila/library_system).
